# ECE 361 Homework #3 -- Stacks, Queues and Hash Tables
## <i>This assignment will be worth 100 points and is due by 10:00 PM on Saturday 27-Oct-2018</i>  

### After completing this assignment students should have:
- Gained experience on module-based C programming for reusability
- Developed and tested (hopefully) reusable modules for Stacks and Queues
- Demonstrated basic knowledge of Hash Tables and Hashing functions

### Introduction

This assignment should be completed by 10:00 PM on Sat 27-Oct-2018.  We are using GitHub classroom for this assignment so make sure you make your final commit to your private GitHub repository for the assignment before the deadline.  Source code for your programming solutions should have a .c extension.  Header files should have a .h extension.  Your transcripts (log files) should be submitted as text files (.txt) by either redirecting the output from your shell to a file or by using the "tee" command to direct output to both the console and a file (ex: $echo "hello world" | tee helloworld.txt).  The call trees in problem 1 can be hand drawn (make sure the figure is readable) and scanned as a .pdf or created with your favorite drawing tool and saved as a .pdf.  Name all of the files in the repository with descriptive names.  Be sure your code is organized well, uses meaningful variable names, and includes comments that aid in understanding the code.

You will submit your work via a private repository using GitHub classroom.  Our plan is to review your work and provide feedback using GitHub classroom but this will be a new experience for us so we'll see how it goes.

NOTES:
-  If you decide to leverage (borrow) existing code for your solutions than please acknowledge the source.  You are encouraged, however, to create original code since that is the best way to learn.  We know how to use Google, too, so copying existing code from the web without acknowledging the source will lead to serious consequences if you are caught cheating.

- You may collaborate with your classmates in the design of the program but your are all expected to submit original work.  There is a difference between collaboration and copying - you don't want to be caught doing the latter since that could affect both your final grade and the grade of the student you copied from.

### Assignment:
Not much to say here.  The problems are described and assigned in hw3.pdf
